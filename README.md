# Simple ChatBot for LBU Applicant Day

A Python chatbot that answers questions about the LBU Applicant Day. It is not very good. It spots words in questions, and provides hopeful answers based on them.

There are no dependencies. It should run with a standard installation of any recent version of Python.

Config is all in the ``settings.json`` file. You can add more questions and answers there.
